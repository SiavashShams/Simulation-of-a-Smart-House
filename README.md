# Simulation-of-a-Smart-House
About
-----
In this project we are going to simulate a smart house equipped with IoT devices to control and monitor the lights, opening and closing a door, and regulating the home's temprature. A user interface dashboard is created in the ThingsBoard IoT platform in order to simulate the smart house. The data trensferring is done via MQTT protocols.

Installation
------------
```sh
pip3 install -r requierments.txt
```
User's guide
------------
Follow the instructions and make your dashboard then in the control.py enter your access token and run the code. You can swtich the lights on and off, or close and open the door by pressing the corresponding buttons while running the control.py.
There is also a guide in Farsi for making your dashboard in this repository. 
Users who want to see the simulations in real-time can visit my public designed dashboard via the [link](https://demo.thingsboard.io/dashboard/5f822670-0a71-11ec-a86d-6b65d9a2866e?publicId=0cc6e910-0a95-11ec-8e0e-d5779c4f3ddd/) and just run the main.exe file
